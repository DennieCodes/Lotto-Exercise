This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Lotto Exercise project is a simple React project practicing downward state data flow  in Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp course on Udemy.

The master branch will showcase my completed Class based version of the project.

There will also be another branch where the project is re-factored using Hooks.
